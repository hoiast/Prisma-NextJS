This is an [Express](https://expressjs.com/) and [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) project. It is a microservice for CRUD operations on people and events. All data is persisted in a [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) database.

# Usage Instructions

### Setup environment file and database

- Make a copy of `.env.example` file and name it `.env`
- Setup a PostgreSQL database and update the connection string in `.env` file. The connection string is defined at `"POSTGRESQL_DATABASE_URL"` variable.

### Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Migrate and Seed Database

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
npx prisma generate
npx prisma db seed
```

### Development Mode

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Production Mode

```bash
npm run prod
```

### Resetting Database

- If you want to reset the database, simply run the following command

  ```bash
  npm run reset-db
  ```

  It will drop the database, create it again and seed it from scratch.
